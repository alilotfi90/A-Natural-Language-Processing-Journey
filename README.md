# A-Natural-Language-Processing-Journey

In this project, we will address the task of predicting whether a review from Steam recommends a game or not. The goal of the project is to explore problem-solving strategies in Natural Language Processing.

This repository will contain images, figures, and histograms related to this project.

Models, some of which may be very similar to existing models, and others that are designed specifically for the purpose of this project.
